# Store Locator Shared Block

Store locators for Edge Delivery Services, perhaps with an App Builder accompaniment.

## Technical Approach

Helix exposes the `store-locator/stores` as a json file that is consumed by the `store-locator` block in this directory.


## Installation 

Add the following file structure to your document-based project:

* [Store Locator Source Docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jaCzCSbFBAAQPr0816HJuUqfMMGRcRiK)

Then configure the [stores](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E3fNEuKiIMSmNCm4wWFVkkTgpAvPT_dGo3mIetlD6yY/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to suit your needs. 

### stores.csv

This is to be imported into a `/store-locator/stores.<xlsx|gsheet>` that tracks the stores and allows you to manage meta data.
