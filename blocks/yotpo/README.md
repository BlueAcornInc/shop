## Technical Approach

This approach is intended for Adobe Commerce Storefront with document based authoring. When a customer wants to render a Yotpo Reviews block, they will add a table to the doc with a header row containing "Yotpo". [View Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUt26xPAzziRJBb_YsyVht3DU0xmRVTDXc7rgmhrxtI/edit?tab=t.0). 


When Helix renders this page, it will parse the table and run the `yotpo.js` in this directory. This file will add the needed script tags to enable Yotpo, and inject the needed `<div>` tag into the block allowing Yotpo to present. 

As a result, Yotpo can be easily integrated into the storefront wherever a merchant wants to display it. See it in action [here](https://locator--showcase-evergreen-commerce-storefront--blueacorninc.hlx.live/yotpo/).

## Block Options

This Adobe Commerce Blocks can be configured within the document-based authoring context by adding optins to the block table within the doc.

## To Do

- [ ] Verify the Yotpo instance ID and URL in the `configs` sheet and make this block reference them, they are currently hardcoded.
- [ ] Review documentation and see how this reviews widget can be configured, add configurability to it so that, from the table in the block, I can add a key/value pair for any personalization options. Document them all in this readme.
- [ ] Test the Yotpo Reviews block integration on a staging environment.
- [ ] Ensure the Yotpo script tags are correctly injected by `yotpo.js`.
- [ ] Validate the Yotpo Reviews block rendering on different devices and browsers.
- [ ] Update documentation with any changes or additional configuration steps.
